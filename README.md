# Nyaapp

The Nyaa App (Nyaapp) is an all in one client for Nyaa that allows you to browse, download, and read literature.

## Features

- Enhanced browsing experience for literature on Nyaa
- Download literature locally directly from the client
- View detailed manga metadata
- Customizable reader with support for cbz format
- Support for single page, double page, long strip reader views
- Reading progress tracking
- Local library management

The idea is that this would be a [Mihon](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon) or Tachiyomi for downloading locally. 

Obviously I still need to figure out the tracking aspect.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Node.js and npm
- Rust and Cargo
- Tauri v2 + [CLI](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/cli/)

Otherwise, you will need to download them yourself. See [tauri docs](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for more info.

These docs assume you have the tauri cli installed. Substitute the tauri command for however you run the tauri cli.

if you are using the flake

idk, distributing software is hard man. just build it yourself until i figure this part out.
