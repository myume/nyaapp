# Nyaapp

The Nyaa App (Nyaapp) is an all in one client for Nyaa that allows you to
browse, download, and read literature.

[![CI](https://github.com/myume/nyaapp/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/myume/nyaapp/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

## Features

- Enhanced browsing experience for literature on Nyaa
- Download literature locally directly from the client
- View detailed manga metadata
- Customizable reader with support for cbz format
- Support for single page, double page, long strip reader views
- Reading progress tracking
- Local library management

The idea is that this would be a [Mihon](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon) or
Tachiyomi for downloading locally.

Obviously I still need to figure out the tracking aspect.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- Rust and Cargo

If you are on nix, there is a flake with the dev environment.

### Install Dependencies

To install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To start development server:

```bash
npm run tauri dev

# or if you have just installed
just
```

We are using SQLx which requires the DATABASE_URL env var to be set for local
developement.

There is a script in the justfile which downloads the metadata db and sets the
var. If you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed, you can use
the following command, otherwise you will need to do this manually.

```bash
just pull-meta
```

### Building

To build the application for production use run

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

## Download

idk, distributing software is hard man. just build it yourself until i figure
this part out.
